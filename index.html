      <div class="article-text">
        <p>
          I’m currently a bootcamp student at Manchester Codes, where I’m studying to become a full-stack web developer. I’m getting to grips in an iterative fashion with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Node.js. I’m passionate about sharpening my mind-tools, learning to learn, and the new powers of creation that coding skills bring.
        </p>  
        <p>
          Sometime after emerging from university with an MA in philosophy, I became a teacher of English as a foreign language (TEFL). In some alternate universe, my counterpart is struggling to finish her PhD in the philosophy of consciousness. In another, my counterpart is teaching kids in Japan and collapsing, exhausted, every evening. Meanwhile, in this here and now, I’m discovering the joys of coding -  of building, of creating. But these other paths have taught me much that can be applied to software development.
        </p> 
        <p>
          The best things about studying philosophy, for me, were analysing concepts and imagining 
          possibilities. Much of philosophy is about defining problems extremely well, and coming up with possible ways forward (or sideways). I’ve been delighted to discover that coding requires these same ways of thinking. On the other hand, the best thing for me about working in TEFL is learning about learning. While I was working in Colombia, I put every effort into learning Spanish and went from zero to reasonably competent in a year or so. This taught me first-hand what I always emphasize to my students: the importance of persistence and real-life practice. Since starting to learn to code, I’ve applied these principles to continually push at the boundaries of what I’m capable of, or what I believe I’m capable of. And just like with human languages, the learning never stops. Onwards and upwards.
        </p>
       <p>Outside of work and other productive activities, I enjoy cycling, hiking, yoga-ing, eating, movie-ing, reading and making friends with dogs.
